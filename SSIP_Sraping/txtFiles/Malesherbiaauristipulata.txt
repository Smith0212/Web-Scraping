Malesherbia auristipulata



Malesherbia auristipulata is a perennial woody shrub in the genus Malesherbia (Passifloraceae).[2] Locally it is called Aj√≠ de Zorra.[3] M. auristipulata is commonly found in Northern Chili[4] and rarely in Tacna, Peru.[5] In general, the species range is very restricted as a result M. auristipulata is considered a rare plant.[3][1] It is likely that there are less than 100 individuals left, classifying the species as critically endangered by the local government.[1]

Malesherbia auristipulata synonymous with Malesherbia turbinea J.F. Macbr; though M. auristipulata is the accepted name.[6]

Malesherbia auristipulata can grow up to 80 cm tall, it is described as a "woody" plant.[1] Leaves are oblong, older leaves are 35-45 mm long by 8-12 mm wide, while younger leaves are 17-25 mm long by 3-6 mm wide.[1]

The flowers of M. auristipulata are described as having tubes that are wider at the throat than the middle, a narrow corona, and blood red petals.[4][7] They are raceme and range from 4 - 35 cm length.[1] It has a dark stem, nearly black in color.[5]

The aerial tissues of M. auristipulata secretes a resin like exudate that has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, with higher efficiency when treating infections of gram positive bacteria than gram negative in vitro.[8] Its medicinal use may inspire the propagation, and ultimately salvation, of the species.[9]
