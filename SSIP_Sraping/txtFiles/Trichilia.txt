Trichilia



Many, see text

Trichilia is a flowering plant genus in the family Meliaceae. These plants are particularly diverse in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America.

Several species are used in folk medicine and shamanism â€“ e.g. T. rubescens against malaria, T. tocacheana as a hallucinogen, and T. catigua in the aphrodisiac and stimulant catuaba. T. emetica wood, also known as Natal mahogany or Cape mahogany is the traditional material of choice for Mozambique's famous psikhelekedana miniature artists. Trichilia dregeana, or forest mahogany also yields timber and is also used in carvings, traditional African musical instruments, household implements, furniture, bats and canoes.
