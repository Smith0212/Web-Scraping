Flemingia



See text.

Flemingia is a genus of plants in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native sub-Saharan Africa, Yemen, tropical Asia, and Australasia.[1] In Asia the species are distributed in Bhutan, Burma, China, India; Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.[2][3] The genus was erected in 1812.

Members of Flemingia are shrubs, or herbs (or subshrubs); evergreen, or deciduous and perennial. They are generally about 0.2–1.5 m high. The stem is prostrate but weak. Leaves are small to medium-sized; not fasciculate, but alternate. The stem and leaves are pubescent, with dense hairs. Leaf blades are flat dorsoventrally. Flowers are aggregated in ‘inflorescences’; not crowded at the stem bases; in racemes, or in heads, or in panicles. Fruits are aerial, about 6–15 mm long; non-fleshy and hairy.[4][5][6]

The number of known species is ambiguous due to taxonomic problems; and is usually enumerated as more than 30. Burma and China have the highest record of Flemingia species with 16 each, followed by India (with 15 species), Thailand (11 species), Laos (10 species), Vietnam (8 species), Bhutan (1 species) and Nepal (5 species).[7] Plants of the World Online accepts 46 species.[1]

Root tubers of Flamingia species have traditionally been used as food for Aborigines of the Northern Territory.[8]

Some species of Flemingia[which?] are used in the herbal medicine traditions of various Asian communities. This is attributed[by whom?] to their unique chemical properties,[medical citation needed] especially those of flavonoids and sterols. Their most common applications in traditional medicine are for epilepsy, dysentery, stomach ache, insomnia, cataract, helminthiasis, rheumatism, ulcer, and tuberculosis.[citation needed]

46 species are accepted.[1]
