Wikstroemia indica



Wikstroemia indica, also known as tie bush, Indian stringbush, bootlace bush, or small-leaf salago (Chinese: 了哥王; pinyin: liǎo gē wáng) is a small shrub with glossy leaves, small greenish-yellow flowers and toxic red fruits.  It grows in forests and on rocky, shrubby slopes in central and southeastern China, Vietnam, India, Australia and the Philippines.[2][3]

W. indica is toxic[4] and the poisoning caused by W. indica leads to dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain and diarrhea.[5]

It is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine.  As a traditional Chinese herb, this plant has long been employed as an antipyretic, detoxicant, expectorant, vermifuge, and abortifacient in clinical practice in China.[5]

An alcoholic extract of the plant was found to contain daphnoretin, chrysophanol, myricitrime and rutin.[6] The extract of W. indica displays antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro.[6]
