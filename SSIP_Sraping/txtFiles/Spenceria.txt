Spenceria



Spenceria ramalana is the lone species in the plant genus Spenceria,[3] known by two varieties.[2] S. ramalana grows from 18–32 cm. tall, and puts out yellow flowers from July through August; bearing fruit (yellowish-brown achenes) from September to October.[2] The Chinese name, ma ti huang [马蹄黄],[2] can be translated to mean "yellow horseshoe".[4]

Henry Trimen, both the genus, and binomial authority of Spenceria, and S. ramalana, respectively, gave an explanation of how he arrived at these names: the genus name was given in honor of Trimen's friend, and fellow botanist, Spencer Moore, who was employed at Kew Herbarium. Trimen thought about choosing a name commemorating the collector of the species, one Captain Gill, R.E., but decided against it, as there already was a genus Gilia (Polemoniaceae), and he wished to avoid, in his words, "the formation of another of precisely similar sound."[5] As the species was collected from a mountain named Ra-Ma-La,[5] it is likely that the specific epithet "ramalana" was chosen as a toponym (the suffix "-ana" meaning "belonging to", hence "from Ra-Ma-La").

Spenceria ramalana is native to Bhutan and China (in the provinces of Sichuan, Xizang (Tibet), and Yunnan).[1]

Spenceria ramalana inhabits limestone soil on montane slopes and meadows (elev. 3000–5000 m.)[2]

Both varieties of S. ramalana have been used locally in traditional folk medicine.[2]
