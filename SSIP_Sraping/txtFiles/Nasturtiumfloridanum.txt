Nasturtium floridanum



Nasturtium floridanum, common names Florida yellowcress[3] and Florida watercress, is an aquatic plant species endemic to Florida, though widely distributed within that state. It is found in wet places at elevations less than 50 m.[4]

Nasturtium floridanum can be distinguished from the more common N. officinale  by its much smaller seeds, less than 2Â mm across.
