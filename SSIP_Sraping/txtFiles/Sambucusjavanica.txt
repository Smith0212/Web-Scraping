Sambucus javanica



Sambucus javanica, the Chinese elder, is a species of elderberry in the family Viburnaceae native to subtropical and tropical Asia. It is found naturally in Bhutan, Burma, Cambodia, China (except in the north), India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia (in Sabah), the Philippines, southern Thailand, and Vietnam.[4][3] It is a perennial herb or a small shrub 1–2 m (3 ft 3 in – 6 ft 7 in) tall.[4]

Parts of the plant are used locally, variously as analgesics, blood purifiers, bowel and bladder stimulants, or even for poison.[5] It is also believed to be an aid against numbness, rheumatism, spasms, swelling, and trauma, as well as for general bone and circulatory health.[5]
