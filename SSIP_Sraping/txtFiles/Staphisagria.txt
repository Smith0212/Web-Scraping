Staphisagria



Staphisagria is a genus in the family Ranunculaceae. It used to be a subgenus or section in the genus Delphinium, but molecular evidence suggests it should be a genus.[1][2]

There are three species in Staphisagria:[1]

Or two, as some botanists think S. requienii and S. picta should be united as one species, with S. picta treated as S. requienii subsp. picta.[3]
