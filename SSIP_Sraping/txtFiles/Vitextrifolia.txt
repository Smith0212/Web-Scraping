Vitex trifolia



Vitex trifolia, the simpleleaf chastetree,[1] is a large coastal shrub or small tree.[2]

Vitex trifolia is a large coastal shrub or small tree, less than 5 m in height with the stems covered by soft hairs (tomentose). The leaves are oppositely arranged along the stems and are usually compound, composed of three linear leaflets which range between 1 and 12 cm in length. The upper surfaces of the leaves are green and the lower surfaces are grayish green.

The flowers are born in panicles or clusters up to 18 cm in length. Individual flowers have purple to violet, two-lipped corollas that are about 5 mm long. The stamens are in two pairs and the ovary is superior, or develops above the corolla. The fleshy fruits are about 6 mm in diameter and contain four small, black seeds.

Vitex trifolia is naturally found along coastlines from tropical East Africa as far east as French Polynesia.

The leaves are used to treat female ailments in the Cook Islands, and used to relieve fever in Samoa.[citation needed] Additionally in Samoa, the dried leaves are burned to deter mosquitos.[citation needed]
