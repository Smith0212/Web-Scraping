Mimosa verrucosa



Mimosa verrucosa, commonly known as jurema-branca ("white jurema") or jurema-de-oeiras, is a species of legume of the genus Mimosa, in the common bean family, Fabaceae.

It is a shrub or small tree native to Brazil (Bahia, Ceará, Paraíba, Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte). It has "near threatened" conservation status as a result of human‐caused deforestation in arid to semi-arid regions of Northeastern Brazil.

The tree grows to about 2.5 to 5 m tall and has blossoms that are pink cylindrical spikes.[3]  The blossom filaments are pink and the anthers are cream colored.[4]

The wood of the tree is used for making charcoal, firewood and wooden stakes.[5]  The bark is used for medicine.[5]

Mimosa verrucosa has been proven to be a very important provider of pollen for Apis mellifera, the European honey bee.[6]

The tree contains the hallucinogen dimethyltryptamine in its root bark.[7]
