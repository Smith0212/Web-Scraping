Sedum dendroideum



Sedum dendroideum, commonly known as the tree stonecrop[2] or the false hens-and-chickens, is a shrub-like perennial plant that looks much like its Sempervivum look-alike. Native to Mexico,[3] Sedum dendroideum plant thrives in warm, arid climates, as well as in cooler climates. It has been naturalized to California,[4] and Ohio.[5]

Due to their appearance and hardiness, like many plants in the sedum family, tree stonecrop are cultivated as garden plants. In winter, its leaves turn red.

In traditional Brazilian medicine, the fresh juice from the leaves of the tree stonecrop plant is used for the treatment of gastric and inflammatory disorders.[citation needed] In 2005, a medical research paper was released studying its uses, finding it had antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects in mice.[6]
