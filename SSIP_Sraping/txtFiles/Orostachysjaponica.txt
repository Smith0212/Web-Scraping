Orostachys japonica (Japanese：爪蓮華、昭和、秀女）also known as rock pine is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae.[1] Native to East Asia. Its main  habitat is on the surface of mountain rocks in Korea, Japan and China.[2][3]

Orostachys japonica is a biennial/perennial plant growing to 10 centimetres (3.9 in). It is in flower from September to October. The flowers are hermaphrodite. The rosette leaves shape like a spatula.[3]

Because of its growing shape which resembles a pine tree's cone, and its habit of growing on mountain rocks, it is also called rock pine.[2]
It grows well in a sunny or semi-shaded(light woodland) location with a well-drained and moist soil that is low in nutrients.
Its flowers bloom from September to October. The flowers are white and each flower has 5 conical petals. The flower lacks a peduncle. Its calyx is divided into 5 parts. When the flowers bloom and produce seeds, it dries out.

The leaves and stems contain several medically active constituents including fatty acid esters, Friedelin and flavonoids.[2] They are antispasmodic and cytotoxic. It has anti-cancer effects in vitro. In Korea, they are used in the treatment of cancer, gingivitis, coagulation and metritis.[2]
