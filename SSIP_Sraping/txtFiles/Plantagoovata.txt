Plantago ovata



Plantago ovata, known by many common names including blond plantain,[1] desert Indianwheat,[2] blond psyllium,[3] and ispaghol,[3] is native to the Mediterranean region and naturalized in central, eastern, and south Asia and North America.[4]

It is a common source of psyllium, a type of dietary fiber.[5] Psyllium seed husks are indigestible and are a source of soluble fiber which may be fermented into butyric acid – a short-chain fatty acid – by butyrate-producing bacteria.[6]  Plantago ovata is the most popular source for commercial products containing psyllium.[7]
