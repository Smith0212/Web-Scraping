Pediomelum cuspidatum



Pediomelum cuspidatum (also known as Psoralea cuspidata) is a perennial herb also known as the buffalo pea, largebract Indian breadroot and the tall-bread scurf-pea. It is found on the black soil prairies in Texas. It has an inflorescence on stems 18-40 centimeters long arising from a subterranean stem and deep carrot-shaped root that is 4–15 cm long. The long petioled leaves are palmately divided into 5 linear-elliptic leaflets that are 2-4 centimeters long. The flowers, borne in condensed spikes from the leaves, are light blue and pea-like.

Pediomelum cuspidata emerges in late Spring, and sets few seeds, unlike its smaller, fecund cousin Pediomelum hypogaeum.
The species has edible tuberous roots, although some sources describe it as 'bitter'.
