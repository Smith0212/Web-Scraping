nonochton



Nonochton is the Classical Nahuatl name for a plant whose identity is uncertain. Suggested plants include Portulaca, Pereskiopsis,[1] and Lycianthes mociniana, a plant now called tlanochtle in the local variety of modern Nahuatl spoken by highland farmers that cultivate it for its fruit.[2]

In Aztec medicine, nonochton was used as an ingredient in a remedy for pain at the heart:

For him whose heart pains him or burns, take the plant nonochton that grows near an antsâ€™ nest, gold, electrum, teo-xihuitl, chichiltic tapachtli and tetlahuitl,[what language is this?] with the burned heart of a deer, and grind them up together in water; let him drink the liquor.
