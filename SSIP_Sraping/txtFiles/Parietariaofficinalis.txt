Parietaria officinalis



Parietaria officinalis, the eastern pellitory-of-the-wall,[1] also known as upright pellitory[2] and lichwort, is a plant of the nettle family. Its leaves, however, are non-stinging. The plant grows on rubbish and on walls, hence the name.

The pollen is a cause of allergy.[3]

It was once used in the making of certain metheglins.[citation needed]
