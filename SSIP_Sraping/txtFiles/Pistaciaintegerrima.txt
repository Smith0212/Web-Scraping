Pistacia integerrima



Pistacia integerrima is a species of pistachio tree native to Asia, commonly called zebrawood.[1] It is often classified as Pistacia chinensis ssp. integerrima.[2] It is used for a variety of purposes in India, including timber, dye, and fodder.[3] The leaf galls are used in traditional herbalism for cough, asthma, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.[3][4]

Long, horn-shaped leaf galls that often develop on this tree are harvested and used to make kakadshringi, an herbal medicine for diarrhea in northern India.[4]

This tree is also used as a rootstock in the cultivation of commercial pistachios.[5]
