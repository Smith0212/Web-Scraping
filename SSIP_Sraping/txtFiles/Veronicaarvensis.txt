Veronica arvensis, common names: wall speedwell,[1]: 592  corn speedwell, common speedwell, rock speedwell,[2] field speedwell,[3] is an annual flowering plant in the plantain family Plantaginaceae. The species is native to Europe and a common weed in gardens, pastures, waste places, and cultivated land.[1]

It is a hairy, erect to almost recumbent, annual herb, 9 to 40 centimetres (3.5 to 15.7 in) high from a taproot. The leaves are oppositely arranged in pairs about the stem. The lower leaves have short petioles; the upper are sessile. Each leaf, 1.5 to 2.5 centimetres (0.59 to 0.98 in) in length, is ovate, or triangular with a truncated or slightly cordate base, with coarse teeth. Borne in a raceme, initially compact but elongating with age, the flowers are pale blue to blue-violet, 2 to 3 mm in diameter, four-lobed with a narrow lowest lobe. Flower stalks are 0.5 to 2 millimetres (0.020 to 0.079 in) and shorter than the bracts. The fruit capsules are heart-shaped and shorter than the sepal-teeth. It flowers from April to October.[1]

It is native to Africa, Asia and Europe.[4]

Veronica arvensis plants go through changes in their germination[5] due to temperature and light that control the timing of growth in buried seed reserves. These plants tend to germinate in consistent temperature ranges of 10 degrees Celsius to 15 degrees Celsius.[citation needed] If they do not make the first autumn cycle of growth, they can grow in the following spring.[citation needed]

It is a medicinal plant.
