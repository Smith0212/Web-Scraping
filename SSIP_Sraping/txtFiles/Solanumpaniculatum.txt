Solanum paniculatum



See text

Solanum paniculatum, commonly known as jurubeba, is a nightshade common in almost all of Brazil. It is used as a medicinal plant and has a bitter taste.[citation needed]

An infusion of its stem and its root in sugar cane alcohol (cachaça) is popularly used as an apéritif or a digestif.

Well known in its native range, this species has been described time and again under different now-invalid names. Some of these are homonyms of other Solanum taxa.[1]

Two varieties were once recognized, but they are not generally considered valid anymore:[1]
