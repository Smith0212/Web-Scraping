Montanoa tomentosa



Montanoa tomentosa is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae which is native to Mexico and much of Central America. Its local common name is zoapatle. This small yellow-flowered shrub is best known for its use in traditional herbal medicine.

In Mexico, there is a history of the use of M. tomentosa as a traditional remedy for sexual dysfunction.  An extract of the leaves was also used to start uterine contractions to induce menstruation, abortion, and labor, and to slow postpartum bleeding.[1][2]  The related species Montanoa frutescens has similar effects in rats, but is much more likely to have contraceptive effects by causing structural changes in the endometrium.[3]

At traditionally medicinally used amounts (75Â mg/kg), M. tomentosa increased expression of sexual and mounting behavior in sexually active male rats and also in genitally anesthetized rats which were previously sexually inactive (noncopulators).[4]
