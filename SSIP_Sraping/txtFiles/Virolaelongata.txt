Virola elongata



Virola elongata (syn. Virola theiodora  ) is a species of tree in the family Myristicaceae.  The tree is native to Panama, Guyana, Brazil (Acre, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia and Roraima), Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.[1][2]  It is also found in Suriname.[2] Virola elongata is thin and 7.5–23 m (25–75 ft) tall, sometimes 30 m (98 ft) tall.[2]

The trunk is about 43 cm (17 in) in diameter, cylindrical and has smooth brown and gray bark.  The fruit is ellipsoidal to subglobular, 11–20 mm (0.43–0.79 in) long, 10–15 m (33–49 ft) in diameter and comes in groups of 40.[2]  The tree is found in evergreen forests and in scrub up to 800 m (2,600 ft) in altitude.[2]

The Yanomami people use the powdered resin as an entheogen known as nyakwána which is inhaled or "snuffed" into the nasal cavity, it contains a high concentration of 5-MeO-DMT and DMT.[3]

Virola elongata extracts have weak antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.[4]
