Elephantopus scaber contains elephantopin which is a germacranolide sesquiterpene lactone containing two lactone rings and an epoxide functional group.[12][13] 17,19-Dihydrodeoxyelephantopin, iso-17,19- dihydro-deoxy elephantopin and 8-hydroxyl
naringenin are the most important bioactive compounds responsible for anti-bacterial activity.[citation needed] By UPLC MS Q-TOF, 34 components were identified.[11]
