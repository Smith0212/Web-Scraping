Sarcandra glabra



Sarcandra glabra is an herb native to Southeast Asia. It is also known as herba sarcandrae or glabrous sarcandra herb. Its common names include the nine-knotted flower and the bone-knitted lotus.[citation needed]

Aromatic oils may be extracted from the leaves. This extract has been shown in mice to reduce immunologic attenuation due to stress.[2]

Leaf blade elliptic or ovate-lanceolate, 6–17 × 2–6 cm, leathery, margin sharply coarsely-serrate. Stamen baculate to terete; thecae shorter than connective. Stigma subcapitate. Fruit globose or ovoid, 3–4 mm in diam.[3]

The plant is distributed in Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Cambodia, Malaysia, India, Japan, Korea, the Philippines and, in China, Jiangxi, Anhui, Fujian, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Zhejiang and other places, growing at an altitude of 420 meters to 1,500 meters, often growing on wet slopes and in shaded valleys.

The plant is called Senryō (千両) in Japanese. It is used during Japanese New Year for chabana decoration, normally along winter jasmine.[4][5] Others plants used instead of Sarcandra glabra because of its similarity to it are coralberry trees and Ardisia japonica.[4]
