Phaseolus ritensis



Phaseolus ritensis is a plant species native to Arizona, Sonora, Chihuahua, Sinaloa and Nuevo Le√≥n. Common names include "Santa Rita Mountain bean" (in US) and "cocolmeca" in Mexico. It grows in forested areas in the mountains.

Phaseolus ritensis is a perennial herb with a large woody taproot. It is a trailing herb with trifoliate leaves and pink to lavender flowers.[2][3][4][5]

The plant is widely valued for both food and medicine throughout much of its native range.[citation needed] Green and ripe fruits served as an important food source in times past. Roots are the source of medicine, glue, and a fermenting agent.[6][7]
