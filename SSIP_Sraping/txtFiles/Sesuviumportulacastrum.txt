Sesuvium portulacastrum



Sesuvium portulacastrum is a sprawling perennial herb in the family Aizoaceae that grows in coastal and mangrove areas throughout much of the world.[3] It grows in sandy clay, coastal limestone and sandstone, tidal flats and salt marshes,[4] throughout much of the world. It is native to Africa, Asia, Australia, Hawai`i, North America and South America, and has naturalised in many places where it is not indigenous.[5]

It is commonly known as shoreline purslane[6] or (ambiguously) "sea purslane," in English, dampalit in Tagalog and 海马齿 hǎimǎchǐ in Chinese.

Sesuvium portulacastrum is vine up to 30 centimetres (12 in) high, with thick, smooth stems up to 1 metre (3.3 ft) long. It has smooth, fleshy, glossy green leaves that are linear or lanceolate, from 1–7 centimetres (0.39–2.76 in) long and 2–1.5 centimetres (0.79–0.59 in) wide.[7][4]

Its flowers come from at the leaf axils, they are tiny, 0.5 centimetres (0.20 in) in diameter and pink or purple in colour.[7][4] They close at night time or when the sky is cloudy, they are pollinated by bees and moths.[3]

The fruit is a round capsule, it has tiny black seeds that do not float.[3]

It was first published as Portulaca portulacastrum by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.[8] Six years later Linnaeus transferred it into Sesuvium,[9] and it has remained at that name ever since, with the exception of an unsuccessful 1891 attempt by Otto Kuntze to transfer the species into a new genus as Halimus portulacastrum.[10]

Fatty acid composition:-
palmitic acid  (31.18%),   oleic acid (21.15%), linolenic acid (14.18%) linoleic acid (10.63%), myristic acid (6.91%) and behenic acid (2.42%)
The plant extract showed antibacterial and anticandidal activities and moderate antifungal activity.[11]

Sesuvium portulacastrum is eaten in the Philippines, where it is called dampalit in Tagalog and "bilang" or "bilangbilang" in the Visayan language.[12] The plant is primarily pickled and eaten as atchara (sweet traditional pickles).
