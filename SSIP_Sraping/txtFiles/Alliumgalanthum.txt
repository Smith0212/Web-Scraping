Allium galanthum



Allium pseudocepa Schrenk.

Allium galanthum is an Asian species of onion in the amaryllis family, commonly called the snowdrop onion.[2] It is native to Xinjiang, Mongolia, Altay Krai, and Kazakhstan. It grows at elevations of 500–1,500 m (1,600–4,900 ft).[3][4][5][6]

Allium galanthum forms a cluster of bulbs, each up to 3 cm (1.2 in) in diameter. Scapes are up to 60 cm (24 in) tall. Leaves are tubular, about half as long as the scapes. Umbels are spherical with a large number of white flowers.[3][7][8]

Allium galanthum is edible and reportedly has medicinal uses.[2][6]
