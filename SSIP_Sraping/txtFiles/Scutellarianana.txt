Scutellaria nana



Scutellaria holmgreniorum

Scutellaria nana is a species of flowering plant in the mint family known by the common names dwarf skullcap[1] and dwarf scullcap. It is native to the western United States, especially in and around the Great Basin. It grows in plateau scrub, often on volcanic soils.[2] It is a small perennial herb producing one or more erect stems up to about 20 centimeters tall from a rhizome. It is coated in tiny flat hairs which sometimes have resin glands. The leaves are oval or diamond-shaped, the lower ones borne on short petioles. Flowers occur in the leaf axils, each borne in a calyx of sepals with a prominent ridge on the upper surface. The corolla is up to 2 centimeters long, tubular in shape, and generally white or yellowish with purple mottling on the lips.

Like several other skullcap species, this plant is used medicinally.
