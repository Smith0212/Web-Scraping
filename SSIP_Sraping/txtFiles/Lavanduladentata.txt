Lavandula pinnataLavandula santolinifolia

Lavandula dentata, the fringed lavender or French lavender, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae, native to the Mediterranean basin, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Yemen, and the Arabian peninsula.[1] Growing to 60 cm (24 in) tall, it has gray-green, linear or lance-shaped leaves with toothed edges and a lightly woolly texture.[2] The long-lasting, narrow spikes of purple flowers, topped with pale violet bracts, first appear in late spring. The whole plant is strongly aromatic with the typical lavender fragrance.[3]

Its native habitat includes low hills with limestone substrates amidst other shrubs. It is present on Madeira and the Canary Islands.[4]

One of several species known by the English common name French lavender (see also Lavandula stoechas),[3] it is commonly grown as an ornamental plant and its essential oil is used in perfumes.[5] Like other lavenders, it is particularly associated with dry, sunny, well-drained conditions in alkaline soil.  But it will tolerate a range of conditions, though it may be short-lived. The cultivar L. dentata var. dentata 'Royal Crown' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[6][7]  It requires some shelter in frost-prone areas.
